##Temperature Transducers
A Temperature Transducer is a device that converts the thermal quantity into any physical quantity such as mechanical energy, pressure and electrical signals

### PT100 vs. PT1000

The primary difference between the two types is the internal resistance. The PT100 has exactly 100 ohms at 0 degrees Celsius, while the PT1000 has exactly 1000 ohms at 0 degrees Celsius. Although both sensors are quite accurate, there are some differences and also criteria by which the appropriate type is chosen.

### PT100
The calculation of a PT100 is more complex than that of a PT1000, because the resistance only changes by a factor of 1/10 compared to the PT1000. For the evaluation unit, this means that the voltage difference is much smaller. Disturbing influences such as the line resistance or the measuring current passing through the PT100 have a much more massive effect as with the PT1000. Nevertheless, there are reasons why the PT100 is used, such as the larger measuring range. If temperatures of more than 200 degrees Celsius occur in the measuring range, the PT100 is definitely the better choice, since mostly the temperature with a resolution of one degree is sufficient even in such large measuring ranges.

### PT1000
The PT1000 has a much higher resolution than the PT100. At 20 degrees Celsius, this sensor already has a resistance of almost 1078 ohms. Compared to the PT100, this would only have 107.8 ohms, which would only make a difference of 7 ohms at 20 degrees Celsius. With a simple voltage divider and a R2 of 10 kiloohm, one could already recognize the temperature change at the second decimal place at 5 volt voltage, which would not be possible with a PT100 without amplification. In addition, also due to the higher internal resistance, the measuring current is much lower and the line resistance through the test leads is less disturbing.
In general, the PT1000 is more suitable than the PT100 for small measuring ranges (-40 to +200 °C).

### Adquisition


0 .-  Voltage dividir with Arduino ADCs. A Pull-Up resistor fixes the current through the PT1000, and a 10kOhm voltage divider allows the Arduino ADC to read the value of the resistor.
  
1 .- High precission discrete design. The  discrete  design  requires  a  precision  amplifier  and  current  source.

2 .- The integrated system approach:
    a) **MAX31865**  RTD-to-digital  converter. This  device  is  well  suited for high-precision applications by providing a 0.03125°C resolution across a -200°C to +850°C temperature range, with a 0.5°C level of accuracy. Max accuracy is 0.03125ºC.

   	b) MAXREFDES67# reference design implements the 4-wire ratiometric configuration and polynomial approximation.

   	c) ADS124x, The ADS1246, ADS1247, and ADS1248 devices are precision, 24-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) that include many integrated features to reduce system cost and component count for sensor measurement applications.

   	d) AD7713 , The AD7713 is a complete analog front end for low frequency measurement applications. The device accepts low level signals directly from a transducer or high level signals (4 ⫻ V REF ) and outputs a serial digital word.

## ADC value to resistance



## Transference equation

The most usual approximation to convert RTD value to temperature is to use a look-up table, i.e. doc/dwg_pT1000_resistance_table.png. 

Those table, usually have a C degree  resolution, in case more preccision is required the Callendar-Van Duse equation migth be used.

For a platinum RTD, [the Callendar-Van Dusen equation](https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/design/technical-documents/app-notes/6/6262.html) describes the relationship between resistance and temperature as:

R(t) = R0 × (1 + A × t +B × t2 + (t - 100) × C × t3),

where

R(t) = RTD resistance
t = temperature
R0 = resistance of the RTD at 0°C
A = 3.908 × 10-3
B = -5.775 × 10-7
C = -4.183 × 10-12 when t < 0°C
C = 0 when t > 0°C
